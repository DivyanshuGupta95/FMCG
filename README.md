Supply Chain Power BI Dashboard

A Supply Chain Power BI dashboard to measure service levels, including On-Time Delivery (OT) %, In-Full Delivery (IF) %, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) % of customer orders. These metrics are tracked daily against target service levels set for each customer.

KEY TERMINOLOGIES-
1. Orders and Lines
-> Orders are nothing but a unique request placed by a customer on a given date
-> Within an order, a customer could request multiple items. Each of these items

2. Measuring Line Fill Rate & Volume Fill Rate
-> Line Fill Rate is an important metric for the supply planning team to understand how many lines they shipped out of the total lines ordered. This metric does not consider the delivery time of the order.
   
-> Volume fill rate or case fill rate is a similar metric useful for the supply planning team to understand the total quantity they are able to ship for a customer per order or for a given period of time

3. On Time delivery %
-> It determines if an order is delivered as per the agreed time with the customer.

4. In Full delivery %
-> It determines if an order is delivered in full as per the requested quantity by the customer.

5. On Time In Full (OTIF) %
-> It determines if an order is delivered BOTH in full and On Time as per the customer order request.
